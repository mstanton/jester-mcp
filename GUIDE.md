### What is Quantum Debugging?

Quantum Debugging means Claude tests **multiple approaches simultaneously** to find the optimal solution. It's like having Claude brainstorm, implement, and benchmark several solutions in parallel.

### Using Slash Commands

Claude-Jester includes powerful slash commands for advanced operations:

#### `/quantum` - Algorithm Optimization

**Usage:** Just ask Claude to use quantum debugging

**Examples:**
- "Use quantum debugging to find the fastest sorting algorithm"
- "Quantum debug the best way to find duplicates in a list"
- "Find the most efficient prime number detection method"

**What happens:**
1. Claude generates 3-5 different approaches
2. Tests each with real performance data
3. Compares memory usage and speed
4. Recommends the optimal solution
5. Explains why it's better

#### `/benchmark` - Performance Testing

**Usage:** Ask Claude to benchmark code performance

**Examples:**
- "Benchmark this sorting function with 1000 iterations"
- "Test the performance of my array processing code"
- "Compare the speed of these two algorithms"

**Results:**
- Statistical analysis (average, min, max, standard deviation)
- Performance recommendations
- Optimization suggestions

### Real Examples

#### Fibonacci Optimization
**You:** "Find the fastest way to calculate the 50th Fibonacci number"

**Quantum Debugging Results:**
- ü•á Matrix Exponentiation: 0.001ms (15,600x faster)
- ü•à Iterative: 12ms 
- ü•â Memoized Recursive: 45ms
- üìä Basic Recursive: 2,340ms

**Winner:** Mathematical matrix solution with O(log n) complexity!

#### Sum of Squares Discovery
**You:** "Optimize calculating the sum of 1¬≤ + 2¬≤ + ... + n¬≤"

**Quantum Discovery:**
- Found mathematical formula: `n(n+1)(2n+1)/6`
- Converted O(n) algorithm to O(1)
- **45,000x speedup** for large inputs
- This is genuine mathematical insight!

- "Optimize this algorithm"
- "What's the most efficient approach for..."
- "Test multiple approaches"

#### 3. Request Security Analysis
**For security checking:**

- "Execute this safely"

#### 4. Use Benchmarking Language
**For performance testing:**
- "Benchmark this with 1000 iterations"
- "Test the performance of..."
- "Compare the speed of these approaches"

### Prompt Patterns That Work Well

#### Algorithm Optimization
```
"I need to [specific task] for [data size/type]. 
Find the fastest approach and test multiple algorithms."
```

#### Production Code
```
"Create production-ready code for [task] that handles 
edge cases and is optimized for performance."
```

which is best for [specific use case]."
```

### Best Results Guidelines

#### Do:
- Specify data sizes and performance requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Claude-Jester Not Working

**Symptoms:** Claude behaves normally, no enhanced features

**Check:**
1. Claude Desktop configuration is correct
2. Path to `standalone_mcp_server.py` is absolute and correct
3. Python is installed and accessible
4. Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes

**Test:** Ask Claude "What's the status of Claude-Jester?" - you should get a detailed status report.

#### Code Execution Fails

**Symptoms:** Error messages when Claude tries to execute code

**Solutions:**
1. **Python not found:** Install Python or check PATH
2. **Permission errors:** Ensure script has execute permissions
3. **Timeout issues:** Ask for simpler code or increase timeout

#### Performance Features Not Working

**Symptoms:** No performance measurements or optimizations

**Check:**
1. Ask specifically for "quantum debugging" or "optimization"
2. Use performance-focused language in requests
3. Request benchmarking explicitly

#### Container Features Unavailable

**Symptoms:** Security warnings but no container isolation

**This is normal:** Container features require Podman installation. The system gracefully falls back to subprocess execution while maintaining security analysis.

### Getting Help

#### Diagnostic Commands

Ask Claude to run these to check system status:

1. **"Check Claude-Jester status"** - Overall system health
2. **"Test code execution with a simple Python example"** - Basic functionality
3. **"Show available quantum debugging features"** - Feature availability
4. **"Benchmark a simple algorithm"** - Performance testing capability

#### Debug Information

If you're having issues, ask Claude for:
- System status report
- Error logs from recent executions
- Available features list
- Configuration verification
